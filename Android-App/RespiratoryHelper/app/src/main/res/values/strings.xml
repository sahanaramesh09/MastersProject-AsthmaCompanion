        1. Stop whatever you are doing and sit upright. Bending over or lying down can constrict your breathing even more. \n\n
        2. Take long, deep breaths helps to slow down your breathing and prevent hyperventilation.
        Breathe in through your nose and breathe out through your mouth. \n\n
        3. Stay calm as it prevents further tightening of your chest muscles and makes your breathing easier. \n\n
        4. The asthma attack could be triggered by dust or chemicals. Get away from the trigger as soon as possible
        and go to any place with clean air. \n\n
        5. Hot caffeinated drinks help to open up the airways slightly, providing some relief for an hour or two. \n\n
        6. If the wheezing, coughing and breathing difficulty do not subside after a period of rest, seek immediate medical attention. \n
